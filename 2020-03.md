# March 2020

I didn't do very much Homebrew in March compared to February, because
of... well, everything happening in the world.

My month was mostly taken up by loads more day job work than usual.  I
worked on [some super important coronavirus
services](https://twitter.com/RichardTowers/status/1243904365506760709?s=20)
(thread) on GOV.UK. It was extremely rewarding and valuable, but also
exhausting. The days are blending into weeks, and weeks don't have
defined ends any more!

After that weekend, I managed to squeeze in an interview as part of
the GitHub "spotlight on open source maintainers" series. A bit of it
was shown at a GitHub all-staff a few days later, and the rest of my
interview will be in a blog post later in the year - once they've made
more sense of my sleep-deprived stuttering, I guess! So that's pretty
cool - thanks to GitHub for the opportunity.

Here's to more rest in April!
