# May 2020

On 26th May 2019 I accepted the invite to join the Homebrew GitHub org. And what a year it's been since then! Some of my non-tech friends said back then "but it's only a package manager", which: yeah, fair enough.

From my first, shaky steps into public GitHub open source [back in 2017](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/2687) to all the things I've done with Homebrew since, I'm pleased to reflect on how far I've come, how much confidence I've gained, and how every Homebrew maintainer I've interacted with has been excellent.

May was a bit of a bugfix squashing month contributions-wise. I fixed a [debug output issue with a package](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/55027) which ended up being the classic "it takes longer to correctly reference the commit message than it did to fix the bug". And I also brushed up on [my regex debugging skills](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7644) - one of these days my brain will remember straight away that Ruby has a `delete_suffix` method.

Of course, with coronavirus stopping international travel and (presumably) most conferences, I'm unlikely to be able to meet up with my co-maintainers again in person for a long while - and even when it's "over", what will the new normal be? It's a bit of a shame because I finally felt confident enough to think about attending RubyConf in the US for the first time this year. Maybe next year!

I have a week off work now, so I plan to start learning more fundamentals of computer science. [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) seems like a good resource for "I don't know where to start" - if I can at least make it a few chapters in, targetting the things I know I need to know but don't, that's progress. I hope that I'll be able to more effectively fix package build failures on Homebrew PRs if I learn some C, plus the next project I'm leading on at work will require knowing more than I currently do about some fundamentals like networking. After _n_ weeks of working weird shift patterns and weekends, though, I'll be catching up on sleep first!
