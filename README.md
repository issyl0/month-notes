## Issy's month notes

These are for myself to keep track of all the things I do as it's
really useful to look back on, and also for my
[Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/issyl0) to know what their
money is going towards.

If you're one of my GitHub Sponsors, thanks so much!

These month notes will only focus on my Homebrew/Linuxbrew
maintenance, and possibly some other open source project
contributions, but crucialy not my day job. However, given my day job
is mostly commits to public repositories, they're easy to find if
you're interested.
