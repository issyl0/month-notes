# April 2020

This must mean that I'm writing this in May. How is it May already?!

This month has been busy. I did *slightly* less work in April and
*slightly* more Homebrew, but the late shifts and weekend shifts at
work still took their toll!

# Homebrew 

We switched from Jenkins to GitHub Actions in April. I didn't do too
much of the actual development of this, but I did [try to write some
JavaScript to improve messaging to users about
auto-merges][bad-actions-js] and [broke new package
releases][fixed-actions-js] for 40 minutes. Lesson learned!

I'm excited to announce that I'm a Google Summer of Code mentor for
Homebrew this year, mentoring the [Sorbet project][gsoc-sorbet] along
with [Misty](https://github.com/mistydemeo). It's set to be
interesting - I'm going to learn tonnes along with the student, I
feel!

I've got a MacBook Pro again! I was lucky enough to be recipient of a
hardware grant, which part-funded my purchase of a MacBook Pro 16".
This means that I can start to more heavily get involved with
Homebrew/homebrew-core formula maintenance - debugging build failures,
for example - and testing of new DSLs to ingegrate Linuxbrew and
Homebrew. Thanks once again to Homebrew and the Software Freedom
Conservancy for putting this grant scheme together! It's nice to have
a real Escape key on a MacBook again, although I do keep hitting `i`
on the touchbar when reaching for it! 

Back on the code side of things, I finished off a previously stalled
PR to [audit `uses_from_macos` usage to only macOS-provided
software][ufm-audit], which was a good introduction into writing
custom RuboCop rules.

# Work

At work, I started an RFC to get us using GitHub Actions for CI
instead of our hand-rolled Jenkins. Maybe starting an RFC at the same
time as trying to tech lead the development of two coronavirus
projects wasn't very sensible, but 80 comments later we're almost at a
decision. Phew!

# Life

Nothing much to report. Lockdown birthday at the start of the month
involved homemade apple and cinnamon cake, which was very nice! It
wasn't a significant birthday anyway!

I've started playing Animal Crossing as a way to force myself to
relax! I don't really know what I'm doing and it's only been a week -
but I'm sure I'll build myself a nice island soon enough!

Had my first remote film night using the Netflix Party extension, with
some Twitter friends. Considering I don't usually watch films, our
group's choice of film (The Half of It) was definitely best watched in
a group!
